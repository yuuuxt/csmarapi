csmarapi python package, but installable. Finished in a rush but just works.

grab source data from [csmar](https://cn.gtadata.com/#/support/doc) and made minimal change.

To check it's just identical to official version: check commit history.

current version is based on csmarapi.rar SHA1: 7EA9D274FFE7CBBF11A254879B941D7FBDAEC0B4
